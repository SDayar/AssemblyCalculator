# AssemblyCalculator
'AssemblyCalculator' is a project based on <span style='color:red;'>Assembly 68k</span>. 
## Usage
As described above, this repository contains the results of my debut learning assembly 68k.
You then might undestand the fact that the calculator doesn't provide all the features similar to the ones you use to see nowadays. Nonetheless, it has all the basic needs you expect to see on a calculator. 
## Operations 
All the basics operations are sustained.
<ul>
  <li>Addition</li>
  <li>Difference</li>
  <li>Multiplication</li>
  <li>Division</li>
</ul>

## Exemple of an operation 
'3+2-4*2' <i>Click <span style='color:red;'>enter</span></i>
